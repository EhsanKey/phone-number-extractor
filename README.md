## Export Phone Numbers from Websites

This program allows you to export phone numbers from websites using node.js.

### How it Works

This repository takes website URLs as input and exports the phone numbers available on those websites for you.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a file named `root-damins.txt` and add the website URLs you want to extract phone numbers from, each URL on a new line.
3. Run the program using node.js (`node index.js`).
4. Check the generated `mobileNumbers.txt` file for extracted phone numbers and `errors.txt` for any errors encountered during the process.
